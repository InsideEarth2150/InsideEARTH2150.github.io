  EARTH 2150 Fans Take Notice: "The Moon Project" is Coming in September</b></p>
<p class="text" align="justify">TopWare Interactive plans to use its increasingly 
  famous EARTH 2150 brand name as a springboard into the ranks of the big players 
  in the real-time strategy genre. The first step along this road is "The Moon 
  Project", which will be released amidst great fanfare along with several other 
  new titles this September. </p>
<p class="text" align="justify"> Welcome to the year 2150, in one of the darkest 
  chapters in the history of mankind. While the Lunar Corporation, Eurasian Dynasty 
  and the United Civilized States wage ferocious battles down on Earth; on the 
  Moon a secret research project has just been unveiled. </p>
<p class="text" align="justify">To find out why the Lunar Corporation is so obsessed 
  with this project, the UCS has assembled a giant armada and sent it off to snoop 
  around the lunar landscape. The action in "The Moon Project" runs simultaneously 
  to EARTH 2150 - Escape from the Blue Planet, TopWare Interactive's award-winning 
  RTS bestseller. </p>
<p class="text" align="justify"> As part of the product's kickoff, TopWare Interactive 
  is planning a massive marketing campaign, which will go far beyond a standard 
  product release. The German publisher intends to make the game absolutely "in", 
  by generating a veritable whirlwind in the gaming community. Stay tuned for 
  more details.</p>
<p class="text" align="justify">World War III and EARTH 3 are two more upcoming 
  titles from the EARTH universe. Both games are based on a new EARTH 2150 engine. 
  This state of the art technology looks set to set new limits and drastically 
  change the face of the real-time strategy genre in the coming years. </p>
