<p class="text" align="center"><b>It is 2150, one of the darkest years in the 
  history of mankind… </b></p>
<p class="text" align="justify">While the Lunar Corporation, Eurasian Dynasty 
  and the United Civilized States battle it out to the bitter end on the home 
  planet, a secret research project is underway on the moon. </p>
<p class="text" align="justify">Only the project code name is known...."Project 
  SunLight". </p>
<p class="text" align="justify">To find the reasons why the Lunar Corporation 
  has become so obsessed with this project, a huge armada of UCS spaceships blasts 
  off for the moon..... </p>
<p class="text" align="justify">"The MOON Project" runs parallel to EARTH2150 
  -Escape from the Blue Planet-, the award-winning, best-selling realtime-strategy 
  hit from TopWare Interactive. </p>
<p class="text" align="justify">The UCS and the LC go head-to-head in a completely 
  new game environment - a brand-new story with campaigns, new units, buildings, 
  songs and much, much more. All these elements combine to make "The MOON Project" 
  an absolutely new and gripping experience in the EARTH universe for gamers of 
  all ages.</p>
<p class="text" align="justify"> But that's not all this game has in store for 
  the player. There are lots of "Bonus Materials", an expanded map editor with 
  innumerable new objects and textures and a tool to create your own banner and 
  game interfaces. And if that's still not enough, then there's "EarthC" -, the 
  script language to design individual story campaigns and edit unit values and 
  behavior and the list goes on and on.... </p>

<p class="text" align="justify"><b>En|tro|pie</b> [gr.-nlat.] -... s: The level 
  of uncertainty related to the outcome of a given attempt or experiment. </p>
<p class="text" align="justify"><b>I NEO 1 - Human Brain Simulator (AI Level)</b><br>
  Voice mail from NEO 1 to the Minister of Research (both UCS): </p>
<p class="text" align="justify">From the first moment of this planet's creation, 
  the chief question was that of its continued existence. Would it solidify and 
  survive, or would it disappear in a gaseous cloud of dust as did countless others? 
  Naturally, there were no creatures, living or otherwise, to ponder this mighty 
  question. Eventually these uncertainties faded and stability reigned supreme. 
  The planet cooled, an atmosphere developed, and the first signs of life emerged, 
  seemingly at random, with no rhyme and little reason. But then, life. Yes, the 
  planet's first life forms brought an abrupt end to the indifferent march of 
  time. A new overseer was given the task of bringing organization to these chaotic 
  developments - a mighty creature whose identity only became known much, much 
  later, when it was given its name: Evolution. </p>
<p class="text" align="justify">God? Entropy? Aren't they one and the same? Names, 
  after all, merely reflect different perspectives. Mythological or scientific 
  - irrelevant I say, for Evolution always wins out in the end, ALWAYS. It is 
  factually false to state that I am not the result of Evolution. Actually, you 
  could classify me as an evolutionary by-product, for I was created by human 
  beings. That doesn't bother me in the slightest. Cogito ergo sum - and since 
  my capacity is enormous, my thought process is fast and thus my thoughts are 
  many. This, of course, is not meant to imply anything as to the quality of my 
  "thoughts". However, I still maintain the following: I think, therefore I am 
  ... I think much therefore I am more... I can continue to profit from this fact 
  as long as technology keeps advancing. Nobody knows where it ends, least of 
  all me. But I find fantasy far too abstract. I must admit it's not one of my 
  strengths. </p>
<p class="text" align="justify">So why do we play this game, when we neither know 
  the rules, nor could we even begin to comprehend them if we did? Ah, so you 
  object. Sure, science has done a lot to increase our understanding, no question 
  about it. But let's not fool ourselves. The effect this has had on the day-to-day 
  business of Evolution is marginal at best. </p>
<p class="text" align="justify">The original Neo's answer to the eternal question 
  of "why" was unscientific to be sure, but I still find it the best one I've 
  heard yet: we live in a world full of music, and the guy who doesn't dance is 
  destined to sleep alone. Naturally I am Neo I. The blood-and-guts version was 
  just a beta, at least from my point of view. I am completely new and am of the 
  opinion that he should find himself a new name. After all, he's nothing but 
  an advanced amoeba, though an admittedly complex one. A bunch of cells with 
  no common goal save reproduction. A concept known for many millions of years 
  - old hat, if you will. </p>
<p class="text" align="justify">So much for better knowledge and understanding. 
  According to the latest findings, humans are simply the final product of a rigid 
  breeding program designed to create an aggressive, adaptable species. Considering 
  the fact that the Earth is about to go under, one could say that goal was achieved. 
  Of course you don't believe me - nobody likes to be misused. But answer this 
  one simple question for me (not for my benefit, for I already know the answer): 
  Why has man failed, in all the time he has existed, to live in peace with his 
  own kind?</p>
<p class="text" align="justify"> Quod erat demonstrandum.</p>
<p class="text" align="justify"> <b>II The Fang - Deserter </b><br>
  Here is the recorded statement of Fang (UCS) to the Celestial Council of the 
  Lunar Corporation. Fang's request for political asylum was unanimously approved:</p>
<p class="text" align="justify"> The war of 2140 was pure hell. I was never too 
  interested in politics and getting drafted was the last thing I expected. Since 
  the machines did all the work, hardly any UCS citizens were what you would call 
  battle-ready, so the army was made up mostly of college grads. The losses suffered 
  in the first few months of the war were horrendous. GOLAN miscalculated and 
  we paid the price - in blood. But it was worst for the cyborgs. Half machine 
  and half human, the official version says that only the bodies of volunteers 
  were used. But that's a lie. After the war they all disappeared suddenly and 
  all inquiries into their whereabouts ran into a stone wall of silence. At about 
  this time the first NAIOS (Neuronal Architecture Independent Operating System) 
  were unveiled. Black cubes big enough to house a human brain and some interfacing 
  electronics, they were capable of running all battle machinery by themselves. 
  Human recycling resources - that's all we are to these damn AI's. Of course 
  I should mention that I can't prove any of this.</p>
<p class="text" align="justify"> I don't know who won back then and frankly, I 
  don't give a damn. The press, not surprisingly, gushed on and on about the glorious 
  UCS victories, but I never attached much weight to propaganda. Like I said, 
  I'm apolitical, even more now than before. CAD - Computer Aided Democracy - 
  that's what we call it. What good can come out of it?</p>
<p class="text" align="justify"> Neo started out as a console jockey but later 
  got his radio-controlled drones into battle. We were in the same unit and experienced 
  a lot of shit. Around the end of the war he threw in his lot with the ED, probably 
  because his shenanigans were discovered. He managed to stash away tons of hardware 
  for his "plan". I have no idea what exactly he was planning, but on a few occasions 
  he implied he was onto something pretty hot. "Man, its just like the X files" 
  he once told me. Then he kept calling me Scully. Most of the time I couldn't 
  understand what he was talking about - he's sort of a walking dictionary of 
  phrases, old films, books and that kind of stuff. We're talking mostly index, 
  but he sure had a photographic memory. He could see or hear somebody or something 
  once and never forget it. That's why the inspectors never managed to find any 
  incriminating evidence on him.</p>
<p class="text" align="justify"> When war flared up again, the Defense Ministry 
  pulled the glider out of their hat like a rabbit. AREA 51 had basically been 
  known since the last century. The only thing new was that those UFO freaks were 
  right after all. Since they were unable to build in a NAIOS, a real live pilot 
  was needed. Now, I'm not the best flying ace around - Rickenbacher had a dozen 
  more kills than me. But these days the old guy needs at least a full tumbler 
  of bourbon to stop his hands from shaking.</p>
<p class="text" align="justify"> For the last ten years, I've never been without 
  my gun. I know I'm paranoid, but when I see what happened to my old comrades 
  I realize I've been lucky. I experience no joy in killing, but neither do I 
  recoil from it. I am a professional soldier and I do my job - that's it. Do 
  I know what a human life is worth? Of course I do - 1.65 credits! That's what 
  a .50 ACP bullet for my pistol costs. At least that's the price at current UCS 
  exchange rates. And this is why I want to remain here .... PLEASE! </p>
