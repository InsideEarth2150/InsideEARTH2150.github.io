          States covers the area of North and South America. At one time during 
          the war, Western Europe and North Africa were also under UCS control, 
          but those territories were lost in the year 2146 and have still not 
          been regained. The UCS is ruled by the "chaos theory". Everything here 
          occurs randomly. </font></td>

            themselves contribute hardly anything to their society, instead living 
            decadent, lazy lives, dedicated only to the pursuit of physical pleasure. 
            All the real work is done by robots. Naturally, a system like this 
            has produced an equally stagnant political system, with government 
            heads randomly chosen by computer. The war between the UCS and the 
            ED has its roots in a long-forgotten quarrel that hardly interests 
            the UCS citizens. But it does ensure a steady stream of entertaining 
            TV news! </font>
