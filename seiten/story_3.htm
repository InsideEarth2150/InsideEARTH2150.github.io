          lay in ruins. All authority and power centers were destroyed and the 
          planet descended into total anarchy. The long process of restoring the 
          old order began some years later. In America, 12 of the previous states 
          were reorganized into the United Civilized States (UCS). In Eastern 
          Europe and Asia, representatives of the Khun clan began building their 
          own dynasty. This strong clan had access to post-Soviet nuclear stockpiles, 
          which gave them a heck of a lot of weight in negotiations with their 
          neighbors. Because the population in these territories was widely dispersed 
          and greatly weakened by the war, the clan was able to incorporate territory 
          very quickly. A new country, called the Eurasian Dynasty (ED) was proclaimed 
          soon afterwards. Both the ED and the UCS were rapidly consolidating 
          and developing their respective territories. By the year 2120 no other 
          power on Earth could match them, and they soon ruled over all areas 
          still supporting life. After years of territorial expansion it became 
          clear that the rulers of these two empires were still power-hungry. 
          War reared its ugly head. </font></td>
