    <td><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">As the situation on Earth continued to
    deteriorate, all those who could afford to do so left. The population of Orbital 1
    increased to the point where a second city was needed. Construction began in 2036, but was
    never completed. In 2037 the first permanent base was set up on the Moon. In 2084, when
    the Great War broke out on Earth, all the residents of Orbital 1 were evacuated to a city
    on the Moon called LUNA 1. Thereafter, the Lunar Corporation broke off all contacts with
    Earth. Since then it has followed an independent development path. Several years later a
    second orbital city was founded, LUNA 2. </font></td>
