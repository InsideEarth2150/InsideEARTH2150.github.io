    <td><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">In the year 2147 the unavoidable war between the
    ED and UCS adversely affected the Earth&#146;s solar orbit. At first the symptoms were
    minimal, causing only slight environmental changes. Then the first signs of impending
    disaster were correctly interpreted in the year 2150 by the Lunar Corporation&#146;s space
    scientists. They calculated that within the next few years the distance between the Earth
    and the Sun would shrink by nearly 17%, causing gravitational forces to rip open the
    planet&#146;s outer crust, destroying all life forms on its surface. The LC warned the
    warring races about the danger. Now the only hope was a mass migration from Earth. But the
    war had forced all scientific activity into the realm of weaponry - space flight research
    had been almost totally ignored. But now all available resources were poured into the
    project. It soon became clear that the only escape route was to Mars. But settling so many
    people there would require enormous material resources. None of the races had the
    resources to do this. So they knew that not all of Earth&#146;s inhabitants would manage
    to escape from the planet in time. Their response was sadly all too typical. Rather than
    joining forces to avoid disaster, another murderous war broke out over the few remaining
    resources. The heads of the Lunar Corporation soon decided to start exploring the Earth
    for the materials they needed. Doing this meant, of course, joining in the war...... </font></td>
