    year 2002 a space research corporation named LUNAR CORPORATION was founded. The company's
    goals, according to its brochure, were to introduce humans to the glories of space travel,
    to monopolize space exploration and, above all, the exploitation of space. During the
    crisis of 2012 - 2014, the Lunar Corporation absorbed the old NASA structure, inheriting
    all its patented space technology.</font></td>
