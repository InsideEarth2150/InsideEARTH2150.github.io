            company completed construction of the first orbiting city. In 2035 
            the first permanent base on the Moon was founded. When the Great War 
            broke out in 2084, the entire orbital city population was moved to 
            the Moon to a newly built city, LUNA1. The Lunar Corporation then 
            broke off all contact with the Earth, essentially becoming an independent 
            country. A few years later, they started construction of another city, 
            LUNA2. By 2150 the population of both cities had swollen to 233,000.
